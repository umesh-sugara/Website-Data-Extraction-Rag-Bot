Analytics FAQs
This section contains FAQs related to the Analytics section
Messages are the count of messages sent by a chatbot during a conversation. You are assigned a specific number of messages per billing period according to your plan that you can see on your dashboard.
Conversations are the unique chat sessions visitors engage with your chatbot during their visit. You can track your conversations with your dashboard and the inbox dashboard. A conversation terminates when a user closes the chat widget.
We count only the messages the chatbot sends to the bot user during any billing period. It will not count any messages sent by the user.
The people who leave their contact information, like phone numbers and email addresses, are considered leads. A lead is part of qualified traffic on your website. These visitors have a high chance of purchasing your services or products.
The visitors who leave their contact information, like phone numbers and email addresses, are leads with our chatbots. In your chatbot, you can mark any question for lead consideration. If the user replies to that question, it will be considered a lead.
Anyone who interacts with Telegram, WhatsApp, and the Facebook bot is considered a subscriber. Subscribers are visible on your Analytics dashboard. You may find them as a contact as well.
You can check out all users on your account in the Analytics. It has a detailed summary of both categories.To Check All Bot Uses, Navigate To Analytics.Find the "Analytics Summary" TabChange The Leftmost dropdown to all bots and the rightmost dropdown to the period you want (weekly, monthly, yearly)To Check A Specific Bot Usage, Navigate To Analytics.Find the "Analytics Summary" TabChange The Leftmost dropdown to the Bot you want to check for and the rightmost dropdown to the time period you want (weekly, monthly, yearly)

Subscription FAQs
This section contains all FAQs related to the subscriptions and plans.
The baby plan is like a trial, but it does not restrict you like everyone else. There is no time limit. Take all the time you want to, size up when you are ready.
You can include three agents with the king plan. You can add more agents at additional charges.
BotPenguin's King Plan allows you to create chatbots for websites, Facebook and Telegram. You can also create conversational landing pages and live chat widgets.
BotPenguin will continue working for you for 10% of your limit once you have reached maximum utilization. Post that, you will be requested to upgrade your current plan, your bots will not be able to bring leads and talk to your customers until you upgrade.
Initially upto 50 Chatbots can be created. However, if someone reaches there, we can extend the limit.
Get in touch with our friendly customer success manager who is handling your account, and they will make the process easy.
Yes, the free plan includes one Bot and sends up to 2000 messages per billing cycle. However, the free plan does not include a WhatsApp bot or other premium features.
BotPenguin gives you 5 times productivity and tenth of the price of its competitors. All the prices are set to make the decision of going with BotPenguin a no-brainer. We can make it an even sweeter deal, if you choose the yearly plan. You need to pay for 10 months, if you choose the yearly plan, two months on us. Also, we do provide a 30% discount to Nonprofit organizations.
You gettwo months freeif you opt for a yearly plan.
It is a decision smart people won't take, but we respect your choices, you can cancel your subscription in settings.
You can cancel your plan whenever you want. However, we will cancel your subscription only at the end of the billing cycle. Once you cancel your plan, you will not receive a new invoice from the next billing cycle. Hence, If you cancel your plan in January, you will not get a new bill in February.
If you upgrade your plan in between a billing cycle, we will deduct the price on your current plan from the new pricing, and you will only have to pay the rest. For example:- Suppose you upgrade to 7K monthly messages at 800 INR, and your current plan costs 400 INR. Then, you will have to pay 400 INR and 18% service tax (only if you reside in India) for upgradation.
There are two options for adding messaging add-ons. You can add 5K or 10 K to your current billing cycle. You can check the pricing on the BotPengion subscription panel.
You can check the pricing on the BotPengion subscription panel.

Successfully integrated BotPenguin WhatsApp bot with Bitrix24.
Leads and contacts created by the WhatsApp bot in Bitrix24 are also created in BotPenguin.
When multiple bots are integrated with Bitrix24, a single contact is created within contacts for each bot in Bitrix24, ensuring no duplicates.
Updates in Bitrix24 (such as Name, Phone Number, Lead Stage, City, Lead Concern) are automatically synchronized with corresponding custom attributes in BotPenguin.
WhatsApp leads are not duplicated if they already exist in BotPenguin.
Website leads can be created with the same phone number, enabling different sessions to be initiated by the user.

BotPenguin is a JS-based software. Hence your browser must support the Java Script. The minimum requirement for some renowned browsers are as follows:
Google Chrome: Version 51 or aboveEdge: Version 14 or aboveSafari: Version 10 or aboveFirefox: Version 52 or above
Google Chrome: Version 51 or above
Edge: Version 14 or above
Safari: Version 10 or above
Firefox: Version 52 or above
We understand the criticality of website speed and responsiveness. Adding a trigger delay only delays the chatbot from opening, but the script of the chatbot is loaded at the same time as the page, which can delay the overall page loading and create latency issues. This happens because of the vast processes that allow chatbots to run smoothly. However, this problem can be solved.
In the document ready function, create a timeout function of 3sec. In that timeout function, create a script element with the details of the script shared while installing the chatbot.
Please note:Do not forget to replace[Your Bot ID]with you bot ID that you can find in your script.
And done, All sorted.
